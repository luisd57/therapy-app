# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`** - read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Layout

Single-context. The repo holds three deployables - `API/`, `landing/`, `dashboard/` - but they share one ubiquitous language (Therapist, Patient, Slot, Schedule Block), so one glossary serves all three. There is no `CONTEXT-MAP.md`.

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-store-instants-as-utc-with-iana-zone-ids.md
│   └── ...
├── API/
├── landing/
└── dashboard/
```

`docs/*` is gitignored by default; `docs/adr/` and `docs/agents/` are explicitly un-ignored so these are versioned artefacts, not scratch.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal - either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0002 (recurring rules anchored to practice local time) - but worth reopening because..._
